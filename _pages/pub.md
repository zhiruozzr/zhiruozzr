  <strong>Adaptive Bayesian Shrinkage of High-Dimensional Panel VARs</strong> (2025) <br>
  <em>with Firmin Doko Tchatoka and Qazi Haque</em><br>
  We develop a Bayesian estimation framework for high-dimensional panel VARs with interactive effects. Our approach combines the Minnesota prior with a global-local shrinkage prior and a spike-and-slab prior to address over-parameterization and control sparsity. The proposed method outperforms popular alternatives in simulations. Applied to euro area sovereign bond markets, it reveals novel spillover dynamics and time-varying networks of financial contagion. <br>

  <strong>Bayesian Network Estimation for High-Dimensional Panel VARs</strong> (2025) <br>
  <em>with Firmin Doko Tchatoka and Qazi Haque</em><br>
  We propose a Bayesian framework for estimating and visualizing network structures in high-dimensional panel VARs using a flexible sparsity-inducing prior. The model captures time-varying directional connectedness and offers new insights into cross-country transmission of macro-financial shocks.

  <strong>Beyond Group Shrinkage Toward Hierarchical Selection in Panel VAR</strong> <br>
  <em>with Firmin Doko Tchatoka and Qazi Haque</em><br>
  This project investigates hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage priors in panel VARs, enabling variable selection at multiple levels (group, equation, and lag). The aim is to improve forecast accuracy and interpretability in structured macro-financial datasets.
