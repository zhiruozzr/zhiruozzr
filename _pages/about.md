# 👋 Welcome

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Econometrics at the University of Adelaide, currently on the 2025–26 academic job market. My research focuses on high-dimensional Bayesian macroeconometrics, structural time series models, and applied macro-finance.

My job market paper develops a novel Bayesian shrinkage framework for high-dimensional panel VARs, addressing estimation challenges in large systems. Applied to euro area sovereign bond markets, it reveals new patterns of contagion and time-varying spillovers. More broadly, I aim to build practical tools that connect modern econometrics with pressing macroeconomic questions, including forecasting under uncertainty and the effects of global shocks.
