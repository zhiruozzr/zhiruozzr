I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Econometrics at the University of Adelaide, actively on the 2025â€“2026 academic job market and available for interviews. 

My research lies at the intersection of Bayesian time series analysis, high-dimensional macroeconometrics, and panel data modeling. I develop methods to better understand complex economic dynamics, especially in environments with heterogeneity, interdependence, and sparsity.

Research Interest

**Primary:** Macroeconometrics, Bayesian Time Series, Panel Data Econometrics
