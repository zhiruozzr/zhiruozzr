Welcome
======

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Econometrics at the University of Adelaide, currently on the 2025â€“2026 academic job market and available for interviews. My work lies at the intersection of Bayesian econometrics, high-dimensional macroeconomic modeling, and applied time series analysis.

My current research focuses on developing and applying Bayesian methods for macroeconomic forecasting and structural analysis. I use high-dimensional time series and panel data models to address issues such as cross-country heterogeneity, global uncertainty, and structural breaks in macroeconomic dynamics. My approach combines econometric theory with scalable computational tools to uncover insights in large, complex datasets.

If you are interested in research collaboration or have questions about my work, please feel free to contact me at [zhiruo.zhang@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:zhiruo.zhang@adelaide.edu.au).
