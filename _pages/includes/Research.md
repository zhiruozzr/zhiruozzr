### **Adaptive Bayesian Shrinkage of High-Dimensional Panel VARs** (2025)  
*with Firmin Doko Tchatoka and Qazi Haque*  
We develop a Bayesian estimation framework for high-dimensional panel VARs with interactive effects. Our approach integrates Minnesota priors with global-local and spike-and-slab priors to handle over-parameterization and sparsity. Applied to euro area bond markets, it uncovers dynamic contagion networks and regime shifts in fiscal-monetary linkages.
